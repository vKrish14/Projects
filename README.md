Overview

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using code or tools. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to web scraping, including sending HTTP requests, parsing HTML, extracting relevant data, and saving the results for further analysis

.
Features

    Introduction to web scraping concepts

    Comparison between manual and automated data extraction

    Using Python libraries to:

        Send HTTP requests to web servers

        Parse and navigate HTML content

        Extract specific data elements (e.g., product names, prices, ratings)

    Exporting scraped data to formats such as Excel, CSV, or Pandas DataFrames

    Code examples and explanations for each step

Requirements

    Python 3.x

    Jupyter Notebook

    The following Python libraries:

        requests

        BeautifulSoup (from bs4)

        pandas

        Other standard libraries as needed

To install the required packages, run:

bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

Usage

    Clone or download this repository.

    Open the Web_Scrapping_Demonstration_UCS546.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

    Follow the notebook cells in order. Each section contains explanations and code snippets for:

        Sending HTTP requests to a target website

        Parsing HTML responses

        Extracting and processing data

        Saving data to a file or DataFrame

    Modify the code as needed for your own web scraping projects.

Project Structure

    Web_Scrapping_Demonstration_UCS546.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing all code, explanations, and demonstrations.

Notes

    Always check the target websiteâ€™s Terms of Service and robots.txt file before scraping.

    This notebook is for educational purposes. Use web scraping responsibly and avoid overloading servers.

    Some websites may use anti-scraping technologies (e.g., CAPTCHAs, dynamic content) that require more advanced techniques not covered in this basic demonstration.
